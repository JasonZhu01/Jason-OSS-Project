## Requirements: 
tensorflow 2.x.x, apache_beam 2.x.x

## Introduction:

Inside Prototype, there are three files: stage1_graph.py, stage1_harder_graph.py, and stage1_partition.py.

Stage1_graph.py constructs the graphs and saves them.
Stage1_harder_graph.py constructs the harder graphs and saves them.
Stage1_partition.py contains a GraphPartitioning class and a BeamGraph class.

To start, 
1. Execute stage1_harder_graph.py
2. Execute stage1_partition.py
